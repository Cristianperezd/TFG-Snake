# Snake Game Implementation and Analysis

This repository contains the code and research related to my Bachelor's Thesis (TFG) on the implementation and analysis of the Snake game. The thesis explores the implementation of the Snake game using Pygame and evaluates the performance of different agents.

## Abstract

This article presents a study on the implementation of the Snake game using Pygame. Two heuristic-based agents, Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS) and A*, have been implemented and evaluated. The study also investigates reinforcement learning (RL) with the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm from Stable Baselines 3. The agents have been evaluated based on their performance in scoring.

The study explores the use of RL in the Snake game by adapting the game environment to the Gymnasium library and utilizing the PPO algorithm. Although the RL agent does not outperform the heuristic-based agents, its performance is analyzed and discussed, highlighting the specific difficulties and limitations in this game scenario.

This research contributes to understanding different methods for approaching the Snake game, revealing the strengths and limitations of heuristic approaches, as well as the challenges associated with RL in this context.
